### Concept

The main idea is to communicate our day-to-day emotion with our lover.

Every day, you can send emotion to your lover. Your lover can set how he/she would take care of you by setting the sensor for an alert. For example, you can set that "please notify me if my lover is happy more than three times a day" or "please notify me if my lover is angry". You can then proceed from here. You can buy a real-life flower, take her to fancy dinner, or talk it through.

Also, both you and lover can see a history of your life. You can look back on how you feel each day.
